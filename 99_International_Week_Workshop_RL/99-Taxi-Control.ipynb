    "# Workshop on Reinforcement Learning or How to drive a taxi in a data-driven way?\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the workshop on Reinforcement Learning. We want to introduce the concept of Reinforcement Learning in a problem-based way with an interactive small example, the so called **Taxi environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four designated pick-up and drop-off locations (Red, Green, Yellow and Blue) in the 5x5 grid world. The taxi starts off at a random square and the passenger at one of the designated locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is move the taxi to the passenger’s location, pick up the passenger, move to the passenger’s desired destination, and drop off the passenger. Once the passenger is dropped off, the episode ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player receives positive rewards for successfully dropping-off the passenger at the correct location. Negative rewards for incorrect attempts to pick-up/drop-off passenger and for each step where another reward is not received.\n",

    "For using the taxi environment you need the `gymnasium` package.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, we implement a `while` loop, sample an **action** from the possible actions in the action space and **do** one step with action in the environment. As an agent, we get the next state (called **observation**, short obs), a **reward** and some additional information whether the episode has ended."
