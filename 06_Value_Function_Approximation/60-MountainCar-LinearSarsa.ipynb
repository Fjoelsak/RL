    "## Introduction to the Mountain Car Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mountain Car environment is a classic benchmark problem in reinforcement learning, provided by Gymnasium. It simulates a car stuck in a valley between two hills, where the goal is to drive up the right hill and reach the flag at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the car's engine is not powerful enough to drive directly up the hill. Instead, the agent must learn to build momentum by first driving back and forth between the hills to reach the goal.\n",
