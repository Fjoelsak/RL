The transition from one state to another is determined by a probability, represented by P(i, j). For example, in this model, a user can move from state C to state A with a transition probability of P(C, A) = 1, and the same applies for other states.\n",

For example, if a web page has 2 outgoing links (like page B), the probability of transitioning from that page is 1/2. These probabilities can be adjusted using a formula that takes into account the likelihood of a user choosing an outgoing link from their current state.\n",
